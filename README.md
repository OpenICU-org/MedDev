# MedDev: Medical Device Regulatory Approval Sunlight License

This is the home repo for MedDev, an attempt to construct a new kind of free-libre open source license aimed specifically at medical devices.
The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the need for open, tranparent devices which are both suppy-chain resilient and fully tested under
normal regulatory regimes. In order to build an system of for-profit and non-profit firms that support such devices to alleviate want 
now and in the future, we believ a license that encourages a new kind of sharing is required: one that allows re-use of device designs
and test documentation by forcing publication at the time of reuse for regulatory clearance.

## Early Efforts

This project is in its infancy. We (Marc Jones and Rob Read for now) are drafting our thoughts via a [shared google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JuYIg1NQoANcDVE1M0iTZImYlMcQ7Ell_UU7sDQGMKw/edit?usp=sharing) for now.

The diagram in the directory may give you a general idea of our approach.
